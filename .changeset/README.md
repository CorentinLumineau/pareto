# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`.

## What is this?

This folder stores "changesets" - markdown files that describe changes made to the codebase. These are consumed by the versioning workflow to:

1. Automatically bump versions in all packages
2. Generate CHANGELOG.md entries
3. Create GitHub releases

## How to use

### When making changes

After making a change that should be released:

```bash
# Create a changeset
pnpm changeset

# Or via make
make changeset
```

You'll be prompted to:
1. Select the type of change (patch/minor/major)
2. Write a summary of the change

This creates a markdown file in this folder describing your change.

### Versioning Strategy

This project uses **unified versioning** - all packages share the same version number.

| Change Type | When to Use | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **patch** | Bug fixes, small improvements | `0.0.0` → `0.0.1` |
| **minor** | New features, non-breaking changes | `0.0.1` → `0.1.0` |
| **major** | Breaking changes | `0.1.0` → `1.0.0` |

### Automated Release Flow

```
Push to main → CI runs → Changesets detected → PR created → Merge → Release
```

The CI will:
1. Detect changesets on push to `main`
2. Create a "Version Packages" PR
3. When merged, create a GitHub release with auto-generated notes

## Commit Message Convention

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `feat` | New feature |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `style` | Code style (formatting, etc.) |
| `refactor` | Code change that neither fixes nor adds |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |
| `test` | Adding/fixing tests |
| `chore` | Maintenance tasks |
| `ci` | CI/CD changes |

### Examples

```bash
feat(api): add product search endpoint
fix(web): correct price display formatting
docs: update README with new setup instructions
chore(deps): update dependencies
```
